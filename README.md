Installation
------------
Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/extend-with-modules.
By default, there are no library files to download because they are served
from the Cloudflare CDN.

Optional: If you want to serve the library files from your own site instead of
the CDN, then visit the admin settings form admin/config/development/tiny_slider
to change the library location setting to Local path.
